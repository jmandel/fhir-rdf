    Observations are often coded in multiple code systems.
      - Loinc provides a very specific code (though not usefully more specific in this particular case)
      - snomed provides a clinically relevant code that is usually less granular than LOINC
      - the source system provides its own code, which may be less or more granular than LOINC
    -->
  <code><!--   LOINC - always recommended to have a LOINC code   -->
    <coding>
      <system value="http://loinc.org"/>
      <code value="3141-9"/>
      <display value="Weight Measured"/>
    </coding><!--   SNOMED CT Codes - becoming more common   -->
    <coding>
      <system value="http://snomed.info/sct"/>
      <code value="27113001"/>
      <display value="Body weight"/>
    </coding><!--   Also, a local code specific to the source system   -->

  </code><!--   In FHIR, units may be represented twice. Once in the
    agreed human representation, and once in a coded form.
    Both is best, since it's not always possible to infer
    one from the other in code.

    When a computable unit is provided, UCUM (http://unitsofmeasure.org)
    is always preferred, but it doesn't provide notional units (such as
    "tablet"), etc. For these, something else is required (e.g. Snomed-CT)
