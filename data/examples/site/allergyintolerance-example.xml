    useful when the substance is not coded, or it's quicker to sort/filter on
    than using terminology based reasoning   -->

      It's possible to list specific things to which the patient responded,
      e.g. chocolate (that happened to contain cashew nuts). This event has
      such a specific substance. Note that systems should ensure that what
      goes in here does not conflict with the substance above, and systems
      processing the data can be sure that what is here does not contravene
      the substance above
