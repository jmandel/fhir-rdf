# FHIR RDF Ontology

Guidance from Tony: To test the ValueSet stuff, open the bridge
ontology and it will import others. If you want the whole message,
go to PatientSafety2 -- that's the overarching ontology -- and you'll
probably get some notices from Protege about finding the imports. But
I've discovered that they're actually in the catalog-v001.xml file.
